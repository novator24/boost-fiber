[section:conditions Condition Variables]

[heading Synopsis]

The class `condition` provides a mechanism for one fiber to wait for
notification `condition`. When the fiber is woken from the wait, then it
checks to see if the appropriate condition is now true, and continues if so. If
the condition is not true, then the fiber then calls `wait` again to resume
waiting. In the simplest case, this condition is just a boolean variable:

    boost::fibers::condition cond;
    boost::fibers::mutex mtx;
    bool data_ready;

    void process_data();

    void wait_for_data_to_process()
    {
        boost::unique_lock< boost::fibers::mutex > lk( mtx);
        while ( ! data_ready)
        {
            cond.wait( lk);
        }
        process_data();
    }

Notice that the `lk` is passed to `wait`: `wait` will atomically add the fiber
to the set of fibers waiting on the condition variable, and unlock the mutex.
When the fiber is woken, the mutex will be locked again before the call to
`wait` returns. This allows other fibers to acquire the mutex in order to
update the shared data, and ensures that the data associated with the condition
is correctly synchronized.

In the mean time, another fiber sets the condition to `true`, and then calls
either `notify_one` or `notify_all` on the condition variable to wake one
waiting fiber or all the waiting fibers respectively.

    void retrieve_data();
    void prepare_data();

    void prepare_data_for_processing()
    {
        retrieve_data();
        prepare_data();
        {
            boost::lock_guard< boost::fibers::mutex > lk( mtx);
            data_ready = true;
        }
        cond.notify_one();
    }

Note that the same mutex is locked before the shared data is updated, but that
the mutex does not have to be locked across the call to `notify_one`.

[variablelist
[[Precondition:] [`lk` is locked by the current fiber, and either no other
fiber is currently waiting on `*this`, or the execution of the `mutex()`
member function on the `lk` objects supplied in the calls to `wait` in all the

fiber will unblock when notified by a call to `this->notify_one()` or
`this->notify_all()`, or spuriously. When the fiber is unblocked (for whatever
reason), the lock is reacquired by invoking `lk.lock()` before the call to

function exits with an exception.]]
